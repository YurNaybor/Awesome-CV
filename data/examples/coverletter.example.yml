      Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the employer does
      (Simply stating that you are interested does not tell why,
      and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know enough about the employer
      or position to relate your background to the employer or position.
      Mention specific qualifications which make you a good fit for the employer’s needs.
      (Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what the employer can do for you.)
      This is an opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your resume.
      Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed. Mention other enclosures if
      such are required to apply for a position.

      Indicate that you would like the opportunity to interview for a position or to talk
      with the employer to learn more about their opportunities or hiring plans. State what you
      will do to follow up, such as telephone the employer within two weeks. If you will be in
      the employer’s location and could offer to schedule a visit, indicate when. State that you
      would be glad to provide the employer with any additional information needed. Thank the
      employer for her/his consideration.
